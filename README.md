# C-Assignments
   This repository includes some small C programs and projects.
  * Assignment-1 includes three small projects.
    - A program adds the given number by checking to the given line. Then it adds the number to the given line with recursion.
    - A program calculates the super digit of the given number. First it generates a number repeater for the given number than it computes       the super digit of that number.
    - A program that prints the sierpinski triangle using recursion based on user's input.
  * Assignment-2 
    - A program that shows path of the underground stations based on given input values. The program tells the appropriate path  and             smallest distance underground stations have.
  * Assignment-3
    - A program that reads the given input file and creates a song playlist using Linked Lists. The program sorts the list in                     chronological, alphabetical order. Also it sorts the list based on duration and random order.
